        <h3>Company statement</h3>

        <p>
          On 25th July, WRc hosted a highly anticipated event titled "The Dishwasher Debate" at their training centre in Swindon. The discussion brought together leaders from water companies, dishwasher manufacturers, industry bodies, and catering industry consultants to discuss and debate the connectivity between commercial dishwashers and Grease Recovery Units (GRUs) in commercial kitchens. The central question was whether dishwashers should be connected to a grease management system, such as a GRU.

          The debate aimed to explore different perspectives and reach a consensus on managing fats, oils, and grease (FOG) discharge from commercial dishwashers.
          
          The event was a continuation of the discussions held during the European FOG Summit in 2022. Water companies, represented by United Utilities, and industry representatives at the forefront of FOG production and disposal, represented by the Foodservice Equipment Association (FEA), convened separately to formulate their position statements.
          
          The debate was opened by Matt Hart (Operations Director, WRc), who noted how the landscape has changed over the last 15 years, with everyone in the water industry now trying to do the right thing and everyone outside of the water industry having a low toleration and high expectation of accountable companies.

        <h3>Water company and foodservice industry position statements</h3>

        <p>
          Tony Griffiths from United Utilities presented the water companies' position statement, supported by Water UK. It outlines that if a dishwasher unit is used solely for sanitisation purposes, it should be connected downstream of the Grease Recovery Unit (GRU). If the dishwasher is intended for washing, it must be connected upstream of the correctly sized and configured GRU.

          The position statement will be published on the Water UK website and utilised by water companies to guide foodservice establishments (FSEs).
          
          Andy Threlfall, Technical and Policy Director at the FEA, shared the perspective of the foodservice equipment industry. A survey of approximately 200 FEA members revealed a mixed response on connecting dishwashers to grease management systems. A significant portion of members (less than 20%) needed a grease management system and cited reasons such as cost, space constraints, and reliance on chemical-based solutions.
